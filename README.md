Snazzy Maps Browser
===================

Snazzy Maps Browser is an Android application that demonstrates the
[custom styling capabilities of Google Maps for Android][custom-styles].
It does so by providing an interface for searching and browsing custom
styles created on the [Snazzy Maps][snazzymaps] website, a community
driven portal for contributing custom map styles.
